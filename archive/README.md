# LEGACY ARCHIVE

This directory contains strict quarantine of the previous "Proveniq Core" implementation which mixed:
1. `_legacy_ui`: A Next.js 15 Frontend (now superseded by specific vertical frontends).
2. `_legacy_python_backend`: A nested Python backend that was never fully integrated.
3. `_legacy_src`: Previous domain logic.

**DO NOT DELETE**.
Reference this code for specific domain logic if needed, but do not import from it.
