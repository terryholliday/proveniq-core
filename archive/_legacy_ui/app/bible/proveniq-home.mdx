# Home: The Ingestion Layer

## 1. The Problem: Dead Capital

An estimated **$6 trillion** in U.S. household physical assets sits economically inert. These assets—electronics, appliances, furniture, tools, collectibles—have real market value but lack the structured identity required for institutional participation.

The core dysfunction:

- **No standardized identity**: Items have no persistent, verifiable identifier.
- **No condition history**: Wear, damage, and maintenance are undocumented.
- **No ownership provenance**: Chain of custody is narrative, not evidence-based.

The result is a massive collateral pool that cannot be priced, monitored, or enforced. Insurance underwriters guess. Lenders ignore. Resale markets discount. Capital that could flow into these assets instead flows elsewhere—or nowhere.

This is dead capital: value that exists but cannot be activated because it cannot be observed.

## 2. The Mechanism: Computer Vision + AI Ingestion

Proveniq Home converts unstructured physical reality into structured, evidence-grade data through a four-stage pipeline.

### Stage 1: Guided Capture

The mobile application guides users through systematic capture:

- **Room sweeps**: 360° panoramic scans with automatic item detection.
- **Item scans**: Multi-angle capture with framing and lighting guidance.
- **Document scans**: Receipts, warranties, serial numbers via OCR.

The system optimizes for **repeatability** (same item, same output) and **evidence quality** (sufficient detail for downstream disputes).

### Stage 2: Vision Model Extraction

Computer vision models process raw media into structured claims:

- **Object detection**: Bounding boxes and segmentation masks.
- **Classification**: Category, brand, model, variant identification.
- **Condition assessment**: Wear patterns, damage detection, completeness scoring.
- **Text extraction**: Serial numbers, labels, documentation via OCR.

Each extracted field is linked to its source evidence (image region, confidence score).

### Stage 3: Knowledge Graph Normalization

Extracted claims are reconciled against a canonical product knowledge graph:

- **Entity resolution**: Matching captures to known products.
- **Attribute normalization**: Standardizing condition grades, categories, specifications.
- **Deduplication**: Preventing double-counting across captures.

### Stage 4: Digital Twin Persistence

The output is a **Digital Twin**: a versioned, evidence-backed record containing:

- Stable asset identifier (content-addressed hash).
- Linked proofs (images, OCR artifacts, model outputs).
- Lifecycle events (condition changes, relocations, ownership transfers).

This Digital Twin is the primitive that downstream modules consume for verification, adjudication, and financing.

## 3. The Defensibility: Data Moat

The competitive moat is the **accumulating asset graph**—a proprietary dataset that improves with scale and is expensive to replicate.

### Network Effects

- **Model improvement**: More captures → better vision models → higher accuracy → more captures.
- **Knowledge graph density**: More products identified → better entity resolution → faster ingestion.
- **Pricing accuracy**: More transactions → better market data → tighter valuations.

### Switching Costs

- **Inventory lock-in**: Migrating a digitized household requires re-capture.
- **History value**: Condition history and provenance accumulate over time.
- **Integration depth**: Connected insurance, lending, and resale workflows create friction.

### Data Exclusivity

- **First-party capture**: Data is generated through user action, not scraped.
- **Evidence-grade quality**: Captures are structured for institutional use, not social sharing.
- **Longitudinal depth**: Continuous updates create time-series value competitors cannot backfill.

The moat widens with each household onboarded. Replicating the dataset requires replicating the user base and their capture history—a years-long, capital-intensive process.

## 4. The Monetization: Lead Generation Engine

Home is not a consumer product with a consumer business model. It is a **lead generation engine** for institutional services.

### Revenue Streams

| Stream | Trigger | Payer |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Verification fees** | Downstream module requests asset validation | Insurer, Lender |
| **Claims workflow** | Loss/damage event triggers adjudication | Insurer |
| **Resale facilitation** | User lists item through platform | Marketplace, Buyer |
| **Underwriting data** | Anonymized asset graph licensed for pricing | Insurer, Lender |
| **Premium conversion** | High-value inventory triggers coverage upsell | Insurer |

### Unit Economics (Simulated)

- **CAC**: $8–12 per household (organic + referral-driven acquisition).
- **Activation rate**: 34% of downloads complete first room capture.
- **Items per household**: 142 average items captured within 90 days.
- **LTV**: $45–80 per household over 3 years (verification + claims + resale).

### Lead Quality

The system generates **pre-qualified, intent-signaled leads**:

- A user who captures jewelry has demonstrated coverage interest.
- A user who captures a damaged item has signaled a claim.
- A user who prices items has indicated resale intent.

This is not spray-and-pray marketing. It is structured demand generation with evidence of asset ownership and user intent attached.
