# Policy Truth: The System of Record Thesis

## The Problem: Binary Verification Failed

In legacy systems (and Gen 1 crypto), verification was binary:
- **Verified**: Yes/No
- **Authentic**: True/False

This failed because **Marketplace participants have different risk appetites.**

- An **Insurer** insuring a $50k asset needs 99.9% certainty.
- A **Lender** cares more about liquidity (can I sell this?) than perfect provenance.
- A **Marketplace** wants velocity—if it's 80% sure, let the buyer decide (Disclosure).

**If the protocol forces a single "True/False", it fails 2 out of 3 participants.**

## The Solution: Policy-Based Truth

Proveniq-Core introduces **Policy Packs**. The Core Ledger doesn't just store "Verified". It stores **"Verified against Policy X v1.0"**.

### 1. Different Truths for the Same Facts

We take the exact same input signals (Optical, Serial, Custody):

| Policy | Persona | Goal | Decision | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Insurer** | Claims Adjuster | Zero Fraud | **REJECTED** | Fraud score 0.35 exceeds strict 0.30 limit. |
| **Lender** | Capital Provider | Liquidity | **REVIEW** | Identity is fine, but Market Volume is too low. |
| **Marketplace** | Seller | Velocity | **VERIFIED** | Disclosure added: "Moderate Fraud Risk". Buyer accepts. |

### 2. Pricing Power

This architecture creates a "Tollbooth" business model.
- **Base Verification**: Free/Cheap (Marketplace Policy).
- **Insurer Grade**: Premium (Requires stricter data, higher compute).
- **Lender Grade**: Specialized (Requires liquidity signals + Locker integration).

We don't just sell "verification". We sell **certainty tuned to specific liabilities.**

## Technical Defensibility (The Moat)

Competitors run "AI Scoring" (Black Box).
We run **Deterministic Policy Engines** (Transparent Contracts).

### Confidence Decay

Truth rots. A verification from 2024 is useless in 2026.
Our **Decay Engine** automates this entropy:
- **Insurer Policy**: Hard expiration in 180 days.
- **Lender Policy**: Extended if held in Proveniq Locker.
- **Marketplace**: Degrades to "Verified with Disclosure" after 1 year.

**This forces recurring revenue (re-verification) and keeps the ledger alive.**

## Conclusion

Proveniq-Core is not just a checker; it is a **Risk Orchestration Layer**.
By decoupling **Facts** (Signals) from **Decisions** (Policies), we become the universal rail for Insurers, Lenders, and Marketplaces simultaneously.
