# PROVENIQ Properties

> **Evidence Infrastructure for the Rental Economy**

## Overview

PROVENIQ Properties is the immutable evidence engine for landlords, property managers, and STR hosts. It creates cryptographically-secured inspection records that hold up in court, insurance claims, and platform disputes.

## The Problem

**$4.6 billion** in security deposits are disputed annually in the US alone. Most disputes come down to one question: *Who damaged what, and when?*

- Photos without cryptographic proof are just opinions with timestamps
- Manual inspection checklists are easily contested
- STR platforms require documented evidence but accept scattered, unverified submissions
- Insurance companies reject claims lacking proper documentation

## The Solution: Golden Master v2.3.1

PROVENIQ Properties implements an **Evidence Engine** with forensic-grade integrity:

### Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **SHA-256 Hashing** | Every evidence file is cryptographically fingerprinted |
| **Canonical JSON** | Inspection data serialized deterministically for cross-language verification |
| **Immutable Records** | Once signed, inspections cannot be altered—only supplemented |
| **Idempotent Upload** | `confirm_idempotency_key` prevents duplicate evidence |
| **Storage Instance Tracking** | Records GCS generation or S3 ETag for immutability proof |

### Evidence Pipeline

```
1. PRESIGN → Client requests upload URL with bound MIME type and size
2. UPLOAD → Client uploads directly to GCS/S3 with presigned URL
3. CONFIRM → Server performs HEAD check, records storage_instance_id
4. HASH → SHA-256 verification queued via jobs_outbox
5. SUBMIT → Canonical JSON frozen, hash computed
6. CERTIFICATE → PDF generated asynchronously
```

## Occupancy Models

PROVENIQ Properties supports three occupancy models:

### Long-Term Residential
- Traditional leases with 12-month terms
- Move-in/move-out inspections
- Both parties sign (tenant + landlord)
- Tenant privacy protected until submission

### Commercial Lease
- NNN leases with square footage calculations
- Pro-rata share tracking
- Enterprise-grade compliance
- Portfolio-level visibility

### Short-Term Rental (STR)
- Booking-scoped inspections (pre_stay, post_stay)
- Host attestation (no guest signature required)
- Auto-generated claim packets for Airbnb/VRBO disputes
- PDF certificates with cryptographic proof

## Mason AI

Mason is the **advisory AI** for cost estimation. It surfaces recommendations but **NEVER** makes binding decisions.

### Mason Rules (Absolute)
- ❌ NEVER automatically denies deposits
- ❌ NEVER automatically dispatches vendors
- ❌ NEVER makes binding decisions without human approval
- ✅ Surfaces cost estimates to humans
- ✅ Recommends actions based on inspection data
- ✅ Generates reports for human review

## Technical Stack

```
Backend:  Python 3.11+ / FastAPI / SQLAlchemy 2.0 async / asyncpg
Database: PostgreSQL (Docker)
Storage:  GCS / S3 (presigned uploads)
Auth:     Firebase Auth (JWT verification)
Frontend: Next.js 14 / TypeScript / TailwindCSS / shadcn/ui
```

## Event Bus Integration

PROVENIQ Properties publishes to the central event bus:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `properties.inspection.created` | Inspection initiated |
| `properties.inspection.submitted` | Locked with canonical hash |
| `properties.inspection.signed` | Both parties signed (immutable) |
| `properties.evidence.confirmed` | Evidence file confirmed |
| `properties.certificate.generated` | PDF certificate created |
| `properties.claim_packet.generated` | STR claim packet ready |

## Integration with ClaimsIQ

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Deposit Disputes** | Inspection evidence feeds dispute resolution |
| **STR Claims** | Claim packets auto-formatted for platform disputes |
| **Damage Assessment** | Mason estimates feed ClaimsIQ valuation |

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Async Only** — No synchronous database calls
2. **Org-Scoped Authorization** — Zero IDOR vulnerabilities
3. **Immutable After Signing** — Corrections create supplemental records
4. **Tenant Privacy** — Landlords cannot view tenant draft evidence
5. **Jobs Outbox** — All async side effects via outbox pattern

## Market Opportunity

- **$4.6B** in disputed deposits annually
- **$40B** short-term rental market
- **Zero** existing infrastructure for forensic-grade rental evidence

## Investment Thesis

PROVENIQ Properties becomes the **truth layer for rental transactions**:

1. Evidence that courts accept
2. Evidence that insurance companies pay on
3. Evidence that platform dispute teams recognize

**If your inspection isn't in Properties, it's just an opinion.**
